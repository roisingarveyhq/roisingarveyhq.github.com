Hello! is mise Róisín Ní Ghairbhith. I'm a candidate for the local elections in North Clare in 2019. 

I've been a community activist for over twenty years, and if I'm elected, my
goal is to bridge the gap between the council and grassroots groups. I'll be
publishing more information here as the campaign but for now, if you'd like to
be involved, you can sign up for my mailing list below!

Go raibh maith agat!
