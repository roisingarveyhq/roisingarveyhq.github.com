I'm a candidate for the local elections in North Clare in 2019. I am running in North Clare because of its people: their resilience and can-do attitude. This hardworking philosophy inspired me to community activism and motivated me to co-found, among other things: Ennistymon Scouts, Mol an Óige Primary School and Fracking Free Clare. I have run numerous fundraising events, including for Ennistymon Hospital, Lahinch Playground and Inagh Camogie Club. I am no stranger to navigating bureaucracy for the benefit of my community. I sourced funding for Tidy Towns groups, Mens’ Sheds, and National Bike Week Events.

Here's what I hope to do as a councillor:

# Supporting Communities

I will work with the people of North Clare to:

* Improve access to health services and housing
* Bridge the gap between services, funding and the people who need them
* Increase supports for older people
* Provide more accessible public transport for North Clare
* Ensure access to funding for voluntary groups and organisations

# Supporting Small Business

Small businesses are the biggest employer in North Clare and a lifeline for the local
economy. I will work to:

* Ensure better access to local training, marketing and support for small businesses
* Promote sustainable tourism in North Clare and help market local tourism businesses
* Work with local entrepreneurs to help future proof Clare businesses against Brexit

# Supporting Farmers & The Food Industry

Farmers have always been the natural custodians of the environment and are very
aware of the effects of climate change. I will:

* Work toward better prices for meat and milk by linking farmers directly to consumers
* Assist with diversification (eg: biofuel, energy generation) and meeting new EU
demands
* Work for a less bureaucratic approach to the cottage food industry in Clare
* Help farmers develop sustainable solutions to meet the challenges of more
regular extreme weather events.
