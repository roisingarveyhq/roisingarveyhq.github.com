Hello! is mise Róisín Ní Gháirbhith. I'm a candidate for the local elections in North Clare in 2019. 

I've been a community activist for over twenty years, and if I'm elected, my
goal is to bridge the gap between the council and grassroots groups. I'll be
publishing more information here as the campaign progresses but for now, if
you'd like to be involved, you can sign up for my mailing list below!

If you're not registered to vote, you can download the from [here](http://www.checktheregister.ie/appforms%5CRFA_English_Form.pdf). 


Go raibh maith agat!
